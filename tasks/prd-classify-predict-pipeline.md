# PRD: Replace Hardcoded Suggestions with Classify → Predict → LLM Pipeline

## Introduction

sigil-ml currently uses a Thompson Sampling bandit (`SuggestionPolicy`) that picks from 11 hardcoded action strings like `suggest_commit` and `suggest_break`. The context parameter is accepted but ignored — it is a context-free bandit. The `QualityEstimator` also contains hardcoded English suggestion strings mapped to quality components.

This architecture is rigid, developer-specific, and does not learn from the user's actual workflow. It cannot adapt to different roles (PM, data scientist, designer) or different working styles within the same role.

This PRD replaces the hardcoded suggestion system with a flexible classification and prediction pipeline. sigil-ml will **classify events into semantic activity categories** and **predict workflow state as a probability distribution**, then write structured predictions to the shared SQLite database. The Go daemon's LLM (already connected via MCP tools) reads these predictions and generates natural language suggestions appropriate to the user's actual context.

The system starts rule-based on day 1 and upgrades to ML as data accumulates. It learns from task outcomes, suggestion feedback, and explicit corrections — getting sharper over time without manual tuning.

**Scope:** This PRD covers sigil-ml (Python) changes only. A companion document covers the Go daemon changes needed to consume the new prediction format and generate LLM-driven suggestions.

## Goals

- Remove all hardcoded suggestion actions and suggestion text from sigil-ml
- Classify raw events into 8 role-agnostic semantic activity categories that work for any knowledge worker
- Predict workflow state as a multi-dimensional assessment (probability distribution over flow states, momentum, focus, activity breakdown)
- Write structured, self-describing predictions to `ml_predictions` for LLM consumption
- Start useful on day 1 with rule-based classification and prediction
- Automatically upgrade to ML models as sufficient data accumulates (~500 events for activity, ~20 completed tasks for workflow)
- Learn continuously from implicit feedback (task outcomes), explicit feedback (suggestion accept/dismiss), and corrections (user-provided classification fixes)
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing `ml_predictions` model names that the Go daemon queries

## User Stories

### US-001: Create ActivityClassifier with rule-based cold start

- [ ] 8 categories defined: `creating`, `refining`, `verifying`, `navigating`, `researching`, `integrating`, `communicating`, `idle`
- [ ] At cold start, both "creating" and "refining" map to a single `editing` category (split later when ML model trains)
- [ ] `classify(event: dict) -> dict` returns `{"category": str, "confidence": float, "method": "rules"|"ml"}`
- [ ] `classify_batch(events: list[dict]) -> list[dict]` classifies a buffer of events

- [ ] Scheduler tracks `ml_correction` event count since last retrain
- [ ] Activity classifier retraining triggers after 500 new events (separate from full retrain cycle)
- [ ] Workflow retraining uses same trigger as stuck/duration (10 completed tasks, 1hr min interval)
- [ ] Correction events trigger immediate activity retrain after 5 corrections (high-signal)
- [ ] `pytest tests/` passes

### US-015: Update server startup and model wiring

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: The ActivityClassifier must classify every event into exactly one of 8 categories: `creating`, `refining`, `verifying`, `navigating`, `researching`, `integrating`, `communicating`, `idle`
- FR-2: At cold start (no ML model trained), `creating` and `refining` both classify as `editing` — they split into distinct categories only after ML training
- FR-3: The ActivityClassifier must include `method` field (`"rules"` or `"ml"`) in every classification so consumers know the confidence calibration source
- FR-4: The WorkflowStatePredictor must output a probability distribution over 5 flow states that sums to 1.0
- FR-5: The WorkflowStatePredictor must compute momentum by comparing event rates in the recent half vs older half of the window
- FR-6: The WorkflowStatePredictor must compute focus score as the inverse of Shannon entropy over the activity category distribution, normalized to [0, 1]
- FR-7: Predictions must be written to `ml_predictions` with model names `"activity"` and `"suggest"` (the latter preserves backward compatibility with Go daemon queries)
- FR-8: Every SQLite connection must set `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` and `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000`
- FR-9: The ActivityClassifier must support incremental learning via `SGDClassifier.partial_fit()` — no full retrain required
- FR-10: The WorkflowStatePredictor must fall back to synthetic data when fewer than 20 completed tasks exist
- FR-11: The system must read `ml_correction` events (kind = `"ml_correction"`, payload = `{"event_id": int, "correct_category": str}`) as gold-standard training labels
- FR-12: The system must read `ml_feedback` events (kind = `"ml_feedback"`, payload = `{"model": str, "accepted": bool}`) to reinforce or weaken state predictions
- FR-13: No hardcoded suggestion text may exist in sigil-ml after implementation — all English-language suggestions are generated by the LLM in the Go daemon
- FR-14: The `QualityEstimator.predict()` return dict must not contain a `suggestion` key
- FR-15: All prediction outputs must be JSON-serializable and self-describing (the LLM reads them without external documentation)

## Non-Goals

- No changes to the Go daemon in this PRD (covered by companion document)
- No changes to the StuckPredictor or DurationEstimator models
- No changes to the `ml_predictions` or `ml_events` database schema (new model names use existing columns)
- No natural language generation in sigil-ml — that is the LLM's job
- No user-facing UI changes
- No new Python dependencies (scikit-learn, numpy, joblib, fastapi, uvicorn only)
- No real-time streaming classification — events are classified in the polling loop, not via websocket
- No cross-session learning (each session starts fresh from persisted weights, not from in-memory state)

## Technical Considerations

### Existing code to reuse
- `config.weights_path(model_name)` for model persistence (`src/sigil_ml/config.py`)
- `_connect()` pattern from `poller.py:226-230` for SQLite connections
- `_write()` method from `poller.py:163-177` for writing predictions
- `event.IsTestOrBuildCmd` pattern from Go's `payload.go` — replicate the command matching logic in Python for terminal event classification
- `FEATURE_NAMES` constant pattern from `stuck.py:14-21` and `duration.py:14-19`
- Synthetic data generation pattern from `synthetic.py:6-91`
- Model train/predict/is_trained/persist pattern from `stuck.py:24-84`

### Key constraints
- **No new dependencies.** SGDClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier are both in scikit-learn >=1.4
- **SQLite WAL mode.** All connections must set WAL pragma. The Go daemon writes events concurrently
- **Model name `"suggest"` preserved.** The Go daemon's `get_predictions` MCP tool queries this name. Changing it requires coordinated Go changes (out of scope)
- **Buffer size.** Poller buffer is 200 events (recently expanded from 50). Activity classification should work within this buffer
- **Prediction TTL.** Activity and workflow predictions use 90-second TTL (same as current suggest)
- **Thread safety.** Models are accessed from the async poller loop and from FastAPI endpoint handlers. Model state must be safe for concurrent reads

### Performance
- Rule-based classification: <1ms per event (dict lookup + string matching)
- ML classification: <5ms per event (SGDClassifier.predict is fast)
- Workflow state prediction: <10ms per window (GradientBoosting on ~15 features)
- Total prediction cycle budget: <50ms (current cycle is ~20ms for 4 models)

## Success Metrics

- Zero hardcoded suggestion strings in sigil-ml codebase
- All 6 event kinds classified into semantic categories with >0.7 confidence
- Workflow state predictions written to `ml_predictions` every prediction cycle
- ActivityClassifier upgrades from rules to ML within 2 days of active use (~500 events)
- WorkflowStatePredictor upgrades from rules to ML within 2 weeks of active use (~20 completed tasks)
- All existing tests pass plus new tests for activity and workflow models
- Go daemon's `get_predictions` MCP tool reads new prediction format without code changes (JSON is self-describing)

## Open Questions

- Should the `editing` cold-start category be written as `"editing"` or should it randomly assign `"creating"`/`"refining"` with 50/50 to generate diverse training data from day 1?
- Should the activity summary include plugin-sourced events (GitHub, Jira) or only core event kinds?
- What is the minimum buffer size needed for reliable workflow state prediction? (Current: 200 events, ~30 minutes of active work)
- Should the WorkflowStatePredictor use the stuck prediction as an input feature, or remain independent?
